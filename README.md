Day 1 – NumPy Vector Practice
This is part of my AI Engineering learning journey (Week 2 – Day 1).
In this file, I practiced basic NumPy vector operations:

✅ Topics Covered:
Create vectors using NumPy

Vector addition: v1 + v2

Scalar multiplication: 2 × v1

GitHub manual upload practice

🧪 Sample Code:
python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np

v1 = np.array([5, 2])
v2 = np.array([3, 7])

print("v1 + v2 =", v1 + v2)
print("2 * v1 =", 2 * v1)
💡 Purpose:
To understand how AI software works with numerical data and vector operations
This is the base step for building smarter applications like:

🤖 AI-based news tools

🎯 Vector direction simulations

📡 Navigation logic
